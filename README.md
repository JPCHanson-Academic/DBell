Take a look at the link and tell me what you the link and tell me what you think re: look and feel. Im currently fixing a background issue but assuming that you have no major issues its pretty much done.
Would you like me to continue after the 9th? im available till the 27th if you'd like, as thats when my 12 mth placement starts.
Also working with hiran over the last couple of weeks its become clear that the current xml tag set is a little limiting with regards to widget embedding. Would you have any objection to the inclusion of another tag with a function similar to a <?php include 'file.extension' ?>. Maybe something along the lines of <import FILE="file.extension" /> this would allow the inclusion of widgets in a way that flows nicely with the rest of the page without compromising the widgets internal structure. If you take a look at my widget on hirans form and my webserver you'll see what i mean.

Let me know if anything ive mentioned is unclear or ambiguous, it can sometimes be difficult to convey things in a text based format.

Sorry installing is done by placing the unpacked theme into the local wordpress themes folder i think its <path to wordpress>/wp-content/themes.
